Hey, team! 

Here's the code I've done so far for the project. Sorry there's not much. I've been running into constant errors preventing me from assigning and rendering backend data properly, but I'll keep at it. 

I figured just having the git repo up so we can start working on the organization-related parts of our project was an important thing to get done, so here's the repo. I have the database structure where facts are stored finished, and managed to sucessfully fetch the data, but trying to use useState to load and render to facts on the page is returning a TypeError that I've been trying to debug for hours.

I haven't done authentication or emailing yet. Both of those will have to come at about the same time since authentication relies on email verification.

After we have our MVP working on our local machines, then we can worry about deploying to Heroku. Deployment should probably be our last step, since functionality and resolving errors is by far more important.

Hopefully we can get these issues sorted out and have something presentable up and running soon.
